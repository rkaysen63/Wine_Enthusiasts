[{"description":"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors.

Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.","points":87,"price":65.0,"province":"Oregon","region_1":"Willamette Valley","region_2":"Willamette Valley","title":"Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)","variety":"Pinot Noir","winery":"Sweet Cheeks"},{"description":"Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot.

Martini 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)","variety":"Cabernet Sauvignon","winery":"Louis M.

Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.","points":85,"price":18.0,"province":"Virginia","region_1":"Monticello","region_2":"Monticello","title":"Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Monticello)","variety":"Bordeaux-style Red Blend","winery":"Autumn Hill"},{"description":"Black plum, charred wood, coffee syrup and cracked black pepper show on the excellently bright nose of this bottling.

It's lifted with juicy berry and black cherry flavors, then expanded with notes of cola, earth, leaf, herb and roasted coffee. Everything is in proportion, and the overall impression is of balance and elegance; depth without excess. It's a style of Cabernet that may have fallen out of favor, but shows exceptional grape growing and winemaking skills.","points":90,"price":23.0,"province":"Washington","region_1":"Columbia Valley (WA)","region_2":"Columbia Valley","title":"Gordon Brothers 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))","variety":"Cabernet Sauvignon","winery":"Gordon Brothers"},{"description":"This 100% varietal wine conveys notes of mortared green herbs, plum, cherry, medicine cabinet and vanilla. It's medium bodied with a supple, enticing feel. Baking spice, cherry and coffee flavors linger on the (very, very) long, coffee-filled finish. The aromas don't all come together but this wine is worth exploring for the remarkable finish, which is about as good as it gets.","points":89,"price":100.0,"province":"Washington","region_1":"Horse Heaven Hills","region_2":"Columbia Valley","title":"Mercer 2012 Eagle & Plow Block 93 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)","variety":"Cabernet Sauvignon","winery":"Mercer"},{"description":"Unmistakably Riesling from the petrol notes that dominates. The winemaker calls it off-dry, but it tastes dry in citrus, white flower and mineral notes, probably due  to the high acidity.
