# Final Project assessment

## Summary of Project
Our team studied wine data since we agreed that it was a fun topic that would lend itself to a nice presentation. 
We initially looked at a travel element but decided that machine learning requirements didn't fit our plans well. We decided to try to predict wine prices using machine learning with a random forest classifier. We decided to bring back some of our original interest in working with a map by creating a story of helping a wine magazine decide on aspects that would go into building a winery. That allowed us to use the machine learning outcome as part of a larger project that incorporated geographic and other aspects of our wine data into our final presentation. 

### Team Assessment
I came into the final project late due to life circumstances, along with another team member. We felt behind but were very lucky to have chosen a good team who had already taken the project pretty far. We jumped in and the group stayed ahead of deliverables. We communicated contantly via meetings and slack messages. Before any meeting ended, we took a minute to clarify when we were meeting next. Whenever someone had to take time away, they communicated in advance so we knew when they would return. And they brought back stories!
Our main trouble was that we all wanted to do well and had some trouble all doing extra work. We wanted to work collaboratively instead of with stringent roles, so this was an expected issue. We managed simply by doing too much and joking about how much we all would stress over the tiniest detail and it was just reflective of the kind of people we are. And the results of the excessive work and worrying were shown when our team got a strong shout-out from our instructor. Our favorite TA tried to tell us we were doing a great job and had nothing to worry about, but we kept bugging  him at all his office hours anyway. (Thanks so much, Artem!)
My advice for a team of overachievers would be to accept that you will worry too much. And to try not to stress out that your team is stressing out. Perhaps also: Make sure your topic is fun so you have a reason to laugh together. 

### Self Assessment
I was initially worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up, starting out the final weeks of class while moving and starting a new job. But I had luckily chatted early on with someone who was easygoing, practical, and smart. We created a team of classy dames who all wanted to make a great presentation but wanted it to be fun and enjoyable for the class. 
My strengths in documentation, storytelling, and design were a great help to the team and were well suited to getting overly picky about perfecting things late in the game. My brain didn't love the 5am wake-ups but it was a delight to make my team laugh with just one or two funny things added to the slides at the last minute. 
My greatest personal challenge was feeling like I wasn't providing enough help to the technical work since I got a late start and had skimped on the last module due to time constraints. But my talent for troubleshooting meant that I was able to come in to zoom meetings when teammates were frustrated to catch easy errors and advise how to move past frustration in more difficult ones. And since I had to remind myself that I had done well in the class overall and that doing my part was enough, I was also able to remind my team that we worried a lot but our presentation would be a success because of the work we put into it. And it was.
